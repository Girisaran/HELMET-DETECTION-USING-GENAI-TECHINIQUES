# HELMET-DETECTION-USING-GENAI-TECHINIQUES
This project uses AI to process CCTV footage and detect bike riders without helmets. YOLOv5 identifies riders, CNN classifies helmet use, and OCR extracts license plates. GANs enhance data for varied conditions. Violators' details are stored, with potential future integration for automated fines and tracking repeat offenders, boosting road safety.
